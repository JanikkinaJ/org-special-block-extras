  The ~doc~ link is for explanatory remarks, documentation, or personal glossary that is
  intended to be used in multiple places.

  However, sometimes we want a “one-off” remark, containing, say, references or additional
  explanation and we want it without the ceremony of first defining a glossary term
  then invoking it. Enter the ~margin~ link. For example:

    
         /Allah[[margin:][The God of Abraham; known as Elohim in the Bible]] does not
                       burden a soul beyond what it can bear./
                                ---Quran 2:286

  In HTML, such “marginal remarks” appear as tooltips; in LaTeX, they appear in the margin.
