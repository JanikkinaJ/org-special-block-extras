  The ~doc~ link shows documentation, but to see the value we can use ~show~ as in:

                          doc:user-full-name
                         show:user-full-name

  This allows us to have ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù sentences:

                        My name is show:user-full-name,
                  and I am using Emacs show:emacs-version ^_^
              My favourite number is <show: (* 2 (+ 3 4 (- pi))) >
     
  To see values of expressions in other programming languages, use Org Babel inline source expressions.
