</span>Hussein ibn Ali is the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, who <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is known</span> to have
declared <span class="bold">&#8220;Hussain is from me and I am from Hussain; God loves whoever loves Hussain.&#8221;</span>

He <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is honoured</span> as &#8220;The Chief of Martyrs&#8221; for his selfless stand for social justice
against Yazid, the corrupt 7&#7511;&#688; caliph. The Karbala Massacre <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is commemorated</span> annually
<span class="hl-line">in the first Islamic month, Muharram, as a reminder to stand against oppression and tyranny;
</span>Jesus Christ, son of Mary, makes an indirect appearance in the story.

A terse summary of the chain of events leading to the massacre may <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be found</span> at

</span>A <span class="italic">(Partial, resp. Total) Graph</span><span class="org-latex-and-related"> $G = (V, E, src, tgt)$ </span>consists of

&#10214; Tersely put, in any category, a <span class="italic">graph</span> is a parallel pair of morphisms. &#10215;

<span class="italic">Edge parallelism</span> is the relation<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $&#926; = src &#10814; src &#728; &#8745; tgt &#10814; tgt&#728;$;</span> two arcs <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are

both exist. Joyously, the name &#8216;&#926;&#8217; is a neat reminder of the concept:
The name is three parallel lines, for the concept of edge(line) parallelism.

+ A graph is <span class="italic">total</span> exactly when <span class="italic">Id &#8838; &#926;</span>; and so &#926; is an equivalence.

+ A graph is <span class="italic"><span class="writegood-weasels">simple</span></span> exactly when <span class="italic">&#926; = Id</span>.

The <span class="italic">associated relation</span> is the relation <span class="italic">_&#10230;_ = src &#728; &#10814; tgt</span> that relates two nodes
when the first is the source of <span class="writegood-weasels">some</span> edge that happens to have the second point
as its target. One uses the associated relation to study properties not
involving partial or parallel arrows. One writes <span class="italic">&#10229;</span> for <span class="italic">&#10230;&#728;</span>;
one writes &#10230;&#8902; for the <span class="italic">reachability</span> relation.

<span class="org-block-begin-line">#+begin_documentation Expression :show t
</span>
An <span class="italic">expression</span> is either a &#8216;variable&#8217; or a &#8216;function application&#8217;; i.e., the name
of a function along with a number of existing expressions.

#+begin_example
 Expr ::= Constant    -- E.g., 1 or &#8220;apple&#8221;
      <span class="org-table">|  Variable    -- E.g., x or apple (no quotes!)</span>
      <span class="org-table">|  Application -- E.g., f(x&#8321;, x&#8322;, &#8230;, x&#8345;)</span>
#+end_example

( One reads &#8216;:=&#8217; as <span class="italic">becomes</span> and so the addition of an extra colon results in a
&#8216;stutter&#8217;: One reads &#8216;&#8759;=&#8217; as <span class="italic">be-becomes</span>. The symbol &#8216;|&#8217; <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is read</span> <span class="italic">or</span>. )

Notice that a constant is really just an application with <span class="italic">n</span> being <span class="italic">0</span> arguments
and so the first line in the definition above could <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be omitted</span>.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a sense, an expression is like a sentence with the variables acting as
pronouns and the function applications acting as verb clauses and the argument
to the application are the participants in the action of the verbal clause.

A <span class="bold">variable of type &#964;</span> is a <span class="italic">name</span> denoting a yet unknown <span class="italic">value</span> of type &#964;;
i.e., &#8220;it is a pronoun (nickname) referring to a person in the collection of people &#964;&#8221;.
E.g., to say<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $x$ </span>is an integer variable means that we may treat it
as if it were a number whose precise value is unknown.
Then, if we let <span class="org-verbatim">Expr &#964;</span> refer to the expressions denoting <span class="italic">values</span> of type &#964;;
then a <span class="bold">meta-variable</span> is <span class="writegood-weasels">simply</span> a normal variable of type <span class="org-verbatim">Expr &#964;</span>.

That is, when we write phrases like <span class="org-verbatim">&#8220;Let E be an expression&#8221;</span>, then the <span class="italic">name</span><span class="org-latex-and-related"> $E$
</span>varies and so is a variable, but it is an expression and so may consist of a
function application or a variable. <span class="bold">That is,</span><span class="bold"><span class="org-latex-and-related"> $E$ </span></span><span class="bold">is a variable that may stand
for variables.</span> This layered inception <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is resolved</span> by referring to<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $E$ </span>as not
just any normal variable, but instead as a <span class="bold">meta-variable</span>: A variable capable of
referring to other (simpler) variables.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expressions, as defined above, are also known as <span class="italic">abstract syntax trees</span> (AST) or
<span class="italic">prefix notation</span>. Then <span class="italic">textual substitution</span> <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is known</span> as &#8216;grafting trees&#8217; (a
monadic bind).

Their use can be clunky, such as by requiring <span class="writegood-weasels">many</span> parentheses and implicitly
forcing a syntactic distinction between equivalent expressions; e.g.,
<span class="italic">gcd(m,gcd(n,p))</span> and <span class="italic">gcd(gcd(m,n),p)</span> look difference even though <span class="italic">gcd</span> is
associative.

As such, one can declare <span class="italic">precedence levels</span> ---a.k.a. <span class="italic">binding power</span>--- to reduce
parentheses, one can declare fixity ---i.e., have arguments around operation
names---, and, finally, one can declare association ---whether sequential
instances of an operation should <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be read</span> with implicit parenthesis to the right
or the to the left--- to reduce syntactic differences.  The resulting expression
are now known to be in a <span class="italic">concrete syntax</span> ---i.e., in a syntactic shape that is
more concrete.

That is, the <span class="bold">conventions</span> on how a <span class="italic">string</span> should <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be parsed</span> as a <span class="italic">tree</span> <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are known</span> as a
<span class="bold">precedence, fixity, and associativity rules.</span>

Similarly, not for operators but one treats <span class="italic">relations</span> <span class="bold">conjunctionally</span> to reduce
the number of &#8216;and&#8217;(&#8743;) symbols; e.g.<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $x &#8804; y + 2 = z \quad&#8801;\quad x &#8804; (y + 2) \,&#8743;\, (y + 2) = z$.</span>
This is <span class="writegood-weasels">very</span> useful to avoid repeating lengthy common expressions, such as <span class="italic">y + 2</span>.

</span>How we prove a theorem<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P\, n$ </span>ranging over natural numbers<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $n$?</span>

any amount of money that is at-least 8 dollars can <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be formed</span>.

Since there are an infinite number of natural numbers, it is not possibly to

<span class="bold">Knocking over dominos is induction:</span>
The natural numbers are like an infinite number of dominoes ---i.e., standing

value<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $\true$?</span> That is, when is<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $&#8704; n &#8226; P\, n = \true$?</span>  <span class="writegood-weasels">Clearly</span>, if<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P$ </span>starts
off being<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $\true$ </span>---i.e., <span class="italic">P 0</span>--- and it preserves truth at every step ---i.e.,
<span class="italic">P n &#8658; P (n + 1)</span>--- then <span class="italic">P n</span> will be true for any choice of<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $n$.</span>

That is, if we consider<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $(&#8469;, &#8804;)$ </span>and<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $(&#120121;, &#8658;)$ </span>as ordered sets and<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P$ </span>starts at
the &#8216;top&#8217; of &#120121; ---i.e., <span class="italic">P 0 = true</span>--- and it is ascending ---i.e., <span class="italic">P n &#8658; P (n +
1)</span>--- and so &#8216;never goes down&#8217;, then <span class="writegood-weasels">clearly</span> it must stay constantly at the top
value of &#120121;. This &#8216;basic observation&#8217; <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is known</span> as <span class="italic">induction</span>.


&#10214; For the money problem, we need to start somewhere else besides 0. &#10215;

<span class="bold">Principle of (&#8220;Weak&#8221;) Mathematical Induction:</span>

</span>  is also true.

&#10214; For the money problem, we need to be able to use the fact that to prove<span class="org-latex-and-related">
$P\,(n + 1)$ </span>we must have already proven<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P$ </span>for all smaller values. &#10215;

<span class="bold">Principle of (&#8220;Strong&#8221;) Mathematical Induction</span>:

&#10214; The &#8216;strength&#8217; of these principles refers to the strength of the inductive
hypothesis. The principles are provably equivalent. &#10215;

</span>
Formally, a &#8220;proof&#8221; <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is obtained</span> by applying a number of &#8220;rules&#8221; to known results
to obtain new results; a &#8220;theorem&#8221; is the conclusion of a &#8220;proof&#8221;.  An &#8220;axiom&#8221;
is a rule that does not need to <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be applied</span> to any existing results: It's just a
known result.

That is, a <span class="bold">rule</span><span class="org-latex-and-related"> $R$ </span>is a tuple<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P&#8321;, &#8230;, P&#8345;, C$ </span>that <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is thought</span> of as &#8216;taking
<span class="bold">premises</span> (instances of known results)<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P&#7522;$&#8217;</span> and acting as a &#8216;natural,
reasonable justification&#8217; to obtain <span class="bold">conclusion</span><span class="org-latex-and-related"> $C$.</span>  A <span class="bold">proof system</span> is a
collection of rules. At first sight, this all sounds <span class="writegood-weasels">very</span> abstract and rather
useless, however it is a <span class="italic">game</span>: <span class="bold">Starting from rules, what can you obtain?</span> <span class="writegood-weasels">Some</span>
games can be <span class="writegood-weasels">very</span> fun! Another way to see these ideas is from the view of
programming:

+ Proving &#8776; Programming
+ Logic   &#8776; Trees (algebraic data types, &#119986;-types)
+ Rules   &#8776; Constructors
+ Proof   &#8776; An application of constructors
+ Axiom   &#8776; A constructor with no arguments

Just as in elementary school one sees addition &#8216;+&#8217; as a fraction with the
arguments above the horizontal line and their sum below the line, so too is that
notation reused for inference rules: Premises are above the fraction's bar and
the conclusion is below.
#+begin_example
                                   12
P&#8321;, P&#8322;, &#8230;, Pn                    +  7
---------------R     versues     ----
      C                            19
#+end_example

Just as there are meta-variables and meta-theorems, there is &#8216;meta-syntax&#8217;:
- The use of a fraction to delimit premises from conclusion is a form of &#8216;implication&#8217;.
- The use of a comma, or white space, to separate premises is a form of &#8216;conjunction&#8217;.

If our expressions actually have an implication and conjunction operation, then
inference rule above can <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be presented</span> as an axiom<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P&#8321; \,&#8743;\, &#8943; \,&#8743;\, P&#8345; \,&#8658;\, C$.</span>

The inference rule says &#8220;if the<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P&#7522;$ </span>are all valid, i.e., true in <span class="italic">all states</span>,
then so is<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $C$&#8221;</span>; the axiom, on the other hand, says &#8220;if the<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P&#7522;$ </span>are true in <span class="italic">a
state</span>, then<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $C$ </span>is true in <span class="italic">that state</span>.&#8221; Thus the rule and the axiom are not
<span class="writegood-weasels">quite</span> the same.

Moreover, the rule is not a Boolean expression.  Rules are thus more general,
allowing us to construct systems of reasoning that have no concrete notions of
&#8216;truth&#8217; ---e.g., the above arithmetic rule says from the things above the
fraction bar, using the operation &#8216;+&#8217;, we <span class="italic">can get</span> the thing below the bar, but
that thing (19) is not &#8216;true&#8217; as we may think of conventional truth.

Finally, the rule asserts that<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $C$ </span>follows from<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P&#8321;, &#8230;, P&#8345;$.</span>  The formula<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P&#8321;
\,&#8743;\, &#8943; \,&#8743;\, P&#8345; \,&#8658;\, C$,</span> on the other hand, is an expression (but it need not
be a theorem).

A &#8220;theorem&#8221; is a syntactic concept: Can we play the game of moving symbols to
get this? Not &#8220;is the meaning of this true&#8221;!  &#8216;Semantic concepts&#8217; rely on
&#8216;states&#8217;, assignments of values to variables so that we can &#8216;evaluate, simplify&#8217;
statements to deduce if they are true.

Syntax is like static analysis; semantics is like actually running the program
(on <span class="writegood-weasels">some</span>, or all possible inputs).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One reads/writes a <span class="italic">natural deduction proof (tree)</span> from the <span class="writegood-weasels">very</span> <span class="bold">bottom</span>: Each
line is an application of a rule of reasoning, whose assumptions are above the
line; so read/written upward.  The <span class="bold">benefit</span> of this approach is that <span class="bold">rules guide
proof construction</span>; i.e., it is goal-directed.

However the <span class="bold">downsides are numerous</span>:
- So much horizontal space <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is needed</span> even for <span class="writegood-weasels">simple</span> proofs.
- One has to <span class="bold">repeat</span> common subexpressions; e.g., when using transitivity of equality.
- For comparison with other proof notations, such as Hilbert style,
  see <span class="org-link"><a href="http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~logicE/misc/logicE_intro.pdf">Equational Propositional Logic</a></span>.

  This is more &#8216;linear&#8217; proof format; also known as <span class="italic">equational style</span> or
  <span class="italic">calculational proof</span>. This corresponds to the &#8216;high-school style&#8217; of writing a

For instance, &#8220;any two theorems are equivalent&#8221; is a statement that speaks about
expressions which happen to be theorems. A logic may not have the linguistic

expressible as an expression <span class="bold">within</span> the logic ---and so cannot be a theorem of
the logic.

For instance, the logic &#119953;&#119902; has expressions formed from the symbols &#8220;&#119953;&#8221;, &#8220;&#119954;&#8221;, and
&#8220;-&#8221; (dash). It has the axiom schema<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $x&#119953;-&#119954;x-$ </span>and the rule &#8220;If<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $x&#119953;y&#119954;z$ </span>is a theorem

the language of this logic does not have variables and so cannot even speak

<span class="bold">Syntax</span> refers to the structure of expressions, or the rules for putting symbols
together to form an expression. <span class="bold">Semantics</span> refers to the meaning of expressions
or how they <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are evaluated</span>.

An expression can contain variables, and evaluating such an expression requires
knowing what values to use for these variables; i.e., a <span class="bold">state</span>: A list of
variables with associated values. E.g., evaluation of<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $x - y + 2$ </span>in the state
consisting of<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $(x, 5)$ </span>and<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $(y, 6)$ </span><span class="writegood-passive-voice">is performed</span> by replacing<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $x$ </span>and<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $y$ </span>by
their values to yield<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $5 - 6 + 2$ </span>and then evaluating that to yield<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $1$.</span>

A Boolean expression<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P$ </span>is <span class="bold">satisfied</span> in a state if its value is <span class="italic">true</span> in that
state;<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P$ </span>is <span class="bold">satisfiable</span> if there is a state in which it <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is satisfied</span>; and<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $P$
</span>is <span class="bold">valid</span> (or is a <span class="bold">tautology</span>) if it <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is satisfied</span> in every state.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span class="writegood-weasels">Often</span> operations <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are defined</span> by how they <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are evaluated</span> (<span class="bold">operationally</span>), we
take the alternative route of defining operations by how they can <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be manipulated</span>
(<span class="bold">axiomatically</span>); i.e., by what properties they satisfy.

For example, evaluation of the expression<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $X = Y$ </span>in a state yields the value
<span class="italic">true</span> if expressions<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $X$ </span>and<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $Y$ </span>have the same value and yields <span class="italic">false</span> if they
have different values.  This characterisation of equality is in terms of
expression <span class="italic">evaluation</span>.  For <span class="italic">reasoning about expressions</span>, a more useful
characterisation would be a set of <span class="italic">laws</span> that can <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be used</span> to show that two
expressions are equal, <span class="bold">without</span> calculating their values.
--- c.f., static analysis versues running a program.

For example, you know that<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $x = y$ </span>equals<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $y = x$,</span> regardless of the values of<span class="org-latex-and-related">
$x$ </span>and<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $y$.</span>  A collection of such laws can <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be regarded</span> as a definition of
equality, <span class="bold">provided</span> two expressions have the same value in all states precisely
when one expression can <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be translated</span> into the other according to the laws.

Usually, in <span class="italic">a</span> logic, theorems correspond to expressions that are true in all
states.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That is, instead of defining expressions by how they <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are evaluated</span>, we may
define expressions in terms of how they can <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be manipulated</span> ---c.f., a calculus.

For instance, we may define basic manipulative properties of operators ---i.e.,
<span class="italic">axioms</span>--- by considering how the operators behave operationally on particular
expressions. That is, one may use an operational, intuitive, approach to obtain
an axiomatic specification (characterisation, interface) of the desired
properties.

More concretely, since<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $(p &#8801; q) &#8801; r$ </span>and<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $p &#8801; (q &#8801; r)$ </span>evaluate to
the same value for any choice of values for<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $p, q, r$,</span> we may insist that a part
of the definition of equivalence is that it be an associative operation.

Sometimes a single axiom is not enough to &#8216;pin down&#8217; a unique operator ---i.e.,
to ensure we actually have a well-defined operation--- and other times this is
cleanly possible; e.g., given an ordering &#8216;&#8804;&#8217;(&#8216;&#8658;, &#8838;, &#8849;&#8217;) we can define minima
&#8216;&#8595;&#8217; (&#8216;&#8743;, &#8745;, &#8851;&#8217;) by the axiom: &#8220;x &#8595; y is the greatest lower bound&#8221;;
i.e.,<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $z &#8804; x &#8595; y \quad&#8801;\quad z &#8804; x \,&#8743;\, z &#8804; y$.</span>

# A proof wherein each step <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is connected</span> to the next step by an explicit
# justification.

This is a &#8216;linear&#8217; proof format; also known as <span class="italic">equational style</span> or <span class="italic">calculational
proof</span>. This corresponds to the &#8216;high-school style&#8217; of writing a sequence of
equations, one on each line, along with hints/explanations of how each line <span class="writegood-passive-voice">was
reached</span> from the previous line. ( This is similar to <span class="bold">programming</span> which
encourages placing <span class="italic">comments</span> to <span class="italic">communicate</span> what's going on to future readers. )

The structure of equational proofs allows implicit use of infernece rules
Leibniz, Transitvitity &amp; Symmetry &amp; Reflexivity of equality, and
Substitution. In contrast, the structure of proof trees is no help in this
regard, and so all uses of inference rules must <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be mentioned</span> explicitly.

For comparison with other proof notations see <span class="org-link"><a href="http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~logicE/misc/logicE_intro.pdf">Equational Propositional Logic</a></span>.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We advocate <span class="italic">calculational proofs</span> in which reasoning is goal directed and
justified by <span class="writegood-weasels">simple</span> axiomatic laws that can <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be checked</span> syntactically rather than
semantically. ---<span class="italic">Program Construction</span> by Roland Backhouse

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculational proofs introduce notation and recall theorems as needed, thereby
making each step of the argument <span class="writegood-weasels">easy</span> to verify and follow. Thus, such arguments
are more accessible to readers unfamiliar with the problem domain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The use of a formal approach let us keep track of when our statements are
equivalent (&#8220;=&#8221;) rather than <span class="writegood-passive-voice">being weakened</span> (&#8220;&#8658;&#8221;). That is, the use of English
to express the connection between steps is usually presented naturally using &#8220;if
this, then that&#8221; statements ---i.e., implication--- rather than stronger notion
of equality.

</span>An operation <span class="underline">&#8853;</span> is associative when it satisfies<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $(p &#8853; q) &#8853; r = p &#8853; (q &#8853; r)$.</span>

Associativity allows us to be informal and insert or delete pairs of
parentheses in sequences of &#8853;'s, just as we do with sequences of
additions ---e.g.,<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $a + b + c + d$ </span>is equivalent to<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $a + (b + c) + d$.</span>

Hence, we can write<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $p &#8853; q &#8853; r$ </span>instead of<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $(p &#8853; q) &#8853; r$ </span>or<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $p &#8853; (q &#8853; r)$.</span>

When an operation is associative, it is best to avoid &#8220;making a choice&#8221; of how
sequences of &#8853; should <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be read</span>, by using parentheses ---unless to make things
clear or explicit for manipulation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More generally, for any two operations <span class="underline">&#8853;</span> and <span class="underline">&#8862;</span>, the &#8220;(left to right) mutual
associativity of &#8853; and &#8862;&#8221; is the property<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $(x &#8853; y) &#8862; z = x &#8853; (y &#8862; z)$.</span> It allows
us to omit parentheses in mixed sequences of &#8853; and &#8862;. For instance, addition and
subtraction are (left to right) mutually associative.

If it satisfies only the first equation,<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $&#119920; &#8853; x = x$,</span> one says
that &#8220;&#119920; is a left-identity for &#8853;&#8221;. If it satisfies only the second
equation,<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $x &#8853; &#119920; = x$,</span> one says that &#8220;&#119920; is a right-identity for &#8853;&#8221;.

For example, implication only has a left identity,<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $(false &#8658; x) = x$,</span> and
subtraction only has a right identity,<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $(x - 0) = x$.</span>

An identity implies that occurrences of &#8220;&#8853; &#119920;&#8221; and &#8220;&#119920; &#8853;&#8221; in an expression are
redundant. Thus,<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $x &#8853; &#119920;$ </span>may <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be replaced</span> by<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $x$ </span>in any expression without

If it is additionally <span class="italic">antisymmetric</span>, one says we have an <span class="bold">order</span>.
- The relation<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $R &#8745; R&#728;$ </span>is the greatest equivalence contained in a preorder<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $R$.</span>

  Indeed, it's <span class="writegood-weasels">clearly</span> symmetric and reflexive, and transitive since &#8216;&#10814;&#8217;
  sub-distributes over &#8216;&#8745;&#8217; and <span class="italic">R</span> and <span class="italic">R&#728;</span> are transitive. Then, for any
  equivalence <span class="italic">&#926; &#8838; R</span>, we have <span class="italic">&#926; = &#926; &#728; &#8838; R &#728;</span> and so <span class="italic">&#926; &#8838; R &#8745; R&#728;</span>.

Instead of reflexivity, if we have irreflexivity we get <span class="bold">strict order</span>:

( <span class="italic">Warning!</span> A &#8220;strict order&#8221; is not an order that is somehow strict. )

$R &#8745; &#8764;Id$;</span> conversely, every strict order<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $R$ </span>gives rise to an order<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $R &#8746;

&#8838;. &#8828;, &#8849; and their associated strict orders by related symbols &lt;, &#8834;, &#8826;, &#8847;,
respectively, with *lack the horizontal line &#8216;&#9472;&#8217; below the symbol to indicate
irreflexivity ---i.e., the line is a suggestive reminder of equality.

When letters <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are used</span> to denote orders, one may see <span class="italic">E</span> for an order since it is
reminiscent of &#8804; and &#8838;, and may see <span class="italic">C</span> for a strict order since it is reminiscent
of &lt; and &#8834;.

Using &#8216;&#8804;&#8217; for <span class="italic">an arbitrary order</span> is not ideal since readers may confuse it with

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A linear <span class="italic">order</span> corresponds to a full upper triangular matrix, <span class="italic">after</span> suitably
arranging rows and columns. A linear (pre)-<span class="italic">order</span> has no (distinct) incomparable
elements.

Any linear ordering <span class="italic">E</span>, with associated strict order <span class="italic">C</span>, satisfies<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $C&#728; = &#8764;E$;</span>
i.e., any linear order &#8216;&#8849;&#8217; satisfies<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $&#8704; x, y &#8226;\quad &#172; (x &#8849; y) \;&#8801;\; y &#8847; x$.</span>

Likewise, for liner order, we have <span class="italic">transitivity E&#10814;C&#10814;E = C</span> and <span class="italic">weakening C &#8838; E</span>;
i.e.,<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $a &#8849; b &#8847; c &#8849; d \;&#8658;\; a &#8847; d \quad\; and\; \quad x &#8847; y \;&#8658;\; x &#8849; y$.</span>

Every order <span class="italic">E</span> can <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be extended</span> to a linear order <span class="italic">E&#8242;</span>; i.e., <span class="italic">E &#8838; E&#8242;</span>.  For the
finite case this <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is known</span> as <span class="italic">topological sort</span>, and for the infinite case this <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is
known</span> as the <span class="italic">Szpilrajn extension</span>.

- For the finite case, the <span class="italic">idea</span> is as follows: If <span class="italic">E</span> is not linear, then there
  are two incomparable elements <span class="italic">x, y</span> (i.e., outside <span class="italic">E &#8746; E&#728;</span>), so we may define
  <span class="italic">an</span> ordering <span class="italic">E&#8321; &#8788; E &#8746; {(x, y)}</span>. We iterate this process and <span class="italic">E&#8345;</span> will
  eventually become linear.

  This process maintains &#8220;the order <span class="italic">E</span>, less the incomparable elements, is
  linear&#8221; invariant throughout. Since each step reduces the number of
  incomparable elements, it must terminate, and the invariant then ensures the
  resulting order is linear. (&#8226;&#768;&#7447;&#8226;&#769;)&#1608;

</span>This property generalises injectivity, univalence, and equivalence...

Recall,
- Univalent: Every source value <span class="italic">x</span> <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is associated</span> <span class="bold">at most one</span> target value <span class="italic">y</span>.
    + I.e., if <span class="italic">x</span> goes to <span class="italic">y</span> and <span class="italic">y&#8242;</span> then <span class="italic">y = y&#8242;</span>.

    + I.e., if <span class="italic">y</span> comes from <span class="italic">x</span> and <span class="italic">x&#8242;</span> then <span class="italic">x = x&#8242;</span>.

</span>- Equivalence: Any given equivalence classes are either identical or disjoint.

</span>    + Moreover, it is a <span class="italic">homogenous</span> relation.

 Now, a <span class="italic">possibly heterogenous</span> relation <span class="italic">R</span> is <span class="italic">difunctional</span> exactly when
<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $&#8704; x, x&#8242;, y&#8242;, y &#8226;\quad  x &#12308;R&#12309; y  &#12308;R&#728;&#12309; x&#8242; &#12308;R&#12309; y&#8242; \;&#8658;\; x &#12308;R&#12309; y&#8242;$.</span>
 That is,<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $R &#10814; R &#728; &#10814; R &#8838; R$;</span> in-fact we have equality<span class="org-latex-and-related"> $R &#10814; R &#728; &#10814; R = R$.</span>
